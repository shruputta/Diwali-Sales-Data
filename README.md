# Diwali-Sales-Data
 Exploratory data analysis using Python with Diwali Sales Data 

 
# Overview

ðŸ“ŒThe Diwali Sales Analysis project focuses on analyzing sales data during the festival to gain insights into customer behavior, improve customer experience, and optimize sales strategies. By performing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization techniques, we aim to identify patterns and trends in the data to make informed decisions..

# Technologies Used
ðŸ“ŒUtilized Python programming language and popular data analysis libraries (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib,Seaborn) to perform data preprocessing, cleaning, and advanced analysis tasks

# Data :
ðŸ“ŒStores the raw data files used for the analysis, including the "diwalisale.csv" dataset. The dataset contains information about sales transactions, including product details, customer information, sales dates, and revenue.

# Methodology
 ðŸ“ŒData Loading: Load the Diwali sales dataset into the code using the panda library. Perform initial data exploration to understand the structure and content of the dataset.
ðŸ“ŒData Cleaning and Manipulation: Handle missing values, remove duplicates if any, and perform necessary data transformations. This step ensures the data is in a suitable format for analysis.
ðŸ“ŒExploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Use pandas, matplotlib, and seaborn libraries to explore the dataset. Analyze different variables, their distributions, and their relationships. Generate various visualizations such as bar plots, pie charts, and scatter plots to uncover patterns and trends.
ðŸ“ŒCustomer Analysis: Analyze customer demographics such as states, occupations, gender, and age groups to identify potential customers. Use bar plots or pie charts to visualize the distribution of customers across different categories.

# Project Results
ðŸ“ŒMost of the buyers are females and even the purchasing power of females are greater than men.
ðŸ“ŒMost of the buyers are working in IT, Healthcare and Aviation sector
ðŸ“ŒMost of the buyers are married (women) and they have high purchasing power.
ðŸ“ŒMost of the orders & total sales/amount are from Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Karnataka respectively
ðŸ“ŒMost of the buyers are of age group between 26â€“35 yrs female.
ðŸ“ŒMost of the sold products are from Food, Clothing and Electronics category.
